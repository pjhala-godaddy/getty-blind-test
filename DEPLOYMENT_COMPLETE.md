## ⚠️ Known Limitation: Image Loading

### Issue
Images are hosted on `isteam.dev-wsimg.com` which is a **GoDaddy internal domain**.

### Impact
- ✅ App works perfectly (UI, navigation, data saving all functional)
- ✅ Image URLs are correctly passed to all components
- ❌ Images won't load for users outside GoDaddy network

### Solutions

#### Option 1: Use GoDaddy VPN ⭐ (Recommended for Internal Use)
**What to do**: All reviewers connect to GoDaddy VPN before accessing the app

**Pros**:
- No code changes needed
- Maintains data security
- Works immediately

**Cons**:
- Requires VPN access

#### Option 2: Host Images Publicly (For External Access)
If you need external users to access:

1. Download all 118 images from `isteam.dev-wsimg.com`
2. Upload to public CDN (Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Imgur)
3. Update `real-data.csv` with new URLs
4. Run the Python parser script again
5. Redeploy
