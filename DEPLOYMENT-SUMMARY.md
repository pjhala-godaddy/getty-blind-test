## 🔗 Deployment URLs

After deploying, you'll have:

| Service | URL Format | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/this-or-that` | Where users access the app |
| **Backend** | `https://your-app.railway.app` | API endpoint |
| **Database** | Internal Railway URL | Auto-configured |

---

## 📊 What Happens During Deployment

### Backend (Railway):
1. Connects your GitHub repo
2. Detects Node.js app in `backend/` folder
3. Adds PostgreSQL database automatically
4. Runs: `npm install` → `npm run build` → `npm start`
5. Gives you a public URL

### Frontend (GitHub Pages):
1. Builds your React app
2. Optimizes static files
3. Publishes to `gh-pages` branch
4. GitHub serves it at your custom URL

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Needed

You only need to do this **once**:

1. **Create GitHub repo**
2. **Connect to Railway** (click a few buttons)
3. **Set backend URL** in frontend `.env.production`
4. **Run deploy command**

That's it! Future updates auto-deploy when you push to GitHub.

## 💡 Deployment Options Comparison

| Option | Setup Time | Monthly Cost | Best For |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Railway + GitHub Pages** | 10 min | $0-5 | ✅ Recommended |
| Vercel (all-in-one) | 5 min | $0-20 | Simple setup |
| AWS Lambda + S3 | 30 min | $0-5 | AWS ecosystem |
| Heroku | 15 min | $7+ | Legacy apps |

## 🎬 Next Steps

### 1. Choose Your Deployment Method

**Quick Test?** Use Railway + GitHub Pages (read `QUICKDEPLOY.md`)

**Need AWS?** Follow AWS section in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Want automated?** Run `./deploy.sh`

### 2. Deploy Backend First

Why? Because the frontend needs the backend URL.

**Railway** (easiest):
1. https://railway.app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Deploy from repo
4. Add PostgreSQL
5. Copy URL

### 3. Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
echo "VITE_API_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/api" > .env.production
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
npm run deploy
```

### 4. Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your GitHub Pages URL
2. Enter your name
3. Start reviewing
4. Check analytics
5. Test with multiple reviewers (incognito windows)

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### "Can't connect to API"
**Check**: Is your backend URL correct in `.env.production`?
```bash
cat frontend/.env.production
```

### "Database connection failed"
**Fix**: Railway auto-sets DATABASE_URL, verify PostgreSQL is added

### "Images not loading"
**Check**: Image URLs are from GoDaddy CDN (should work)

### "Build failed on Railway"
**Fix**: Check Railway logs, verify `package.json` scripts are correct

## 💰 Expected Costs

### Testing Phase (Now):
- Railway: **$0** (free $5 credit)
- GitHub Pages: **$0**
- **Total: FREE**

### Production (If scaling up):
- Railway Hobby: **$5/month**
- GitHub Pages: **$0**
- **Total: $5/month**

### Heavy Usage:
- Railway Pro: **$20/month**
- AWS Alternative: **$15-30/month**

**For internal GoDaddy tool with ~50 reviewers**: Railway free tier is enough!
